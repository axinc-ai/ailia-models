This model summarizes the text.
It computes a score for each sentence separated by a newline.
The sentences are then extracted in order of highest score.
In this program, the default number of sentences to be extracted is set to 3.
If you want to change it, change NUM_PREDICT in the program.
The delimiter can also be changed by SPLIT_CHAR.
