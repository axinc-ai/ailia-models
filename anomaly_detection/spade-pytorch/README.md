## Requirements
This model recommends the additional module.

```
pip3 install torch
```

## Usage
Automatically downloads the onnx and prototxt files on the first run.
It is necessary to be connected to the Internet while downloading.

In order to get the feature vector of the normal product, it is necessary to prepare the file of the normal product.  
By default, normal files are got from the `train` directory.  

To calculate the threshold you also need to prepare some test images and corresponding ground truth images.
By default, test images are taken from the `images` directory and ground truth images are taken from the `gt_masks` directory.

For the sample image, first download [MVTec AD datasets](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/) and place `bottle/train/good/*.png` files to the `train` directory.  
Also place `bottle/test/*/*.png` files to the `images` directory, and `bottle/ground_truth/*/*.png` files to the `gt_masks` directory.

Run the following script to prepare the above files.
```bash
$ bash setup_images.sh bottle
```

For the sample image,
```bash
$ python3 spade-pytorch.py -th 0.099380
```

If you want to specify the input image, put the image path after the `--input` option.  
You can use `--savepath` option to change the name of the output file to save.
```bash
$ python3 spade-pytorch.py --input IMAGE_PATH --savepath SAVE_IMAGE_PATH
```

The feature vectors created from files in the train directory are saved to the pickle file.  
From the second time, by specifying the pickle file by `--feat` option,
it can omit the calculation of the feature vector of the normal product.  
The name of the pickle file created is the same as the name of a normal product file directory.
```bash
$ python3 spade-pytorch.py --feat train.pkl
```

You can specify the directory of normal product files with the `--train_dir` option.
```bash
$ python3 spade-pytorch.py --train_dir train
```

The ground truth files are got from the `gt_masks` directory by default.  
The name of the ground truth file corresponds to the file with `__mask` after the name of the input file.  
You can specify the directory of ground truth files with the `--gt_dir` option.
```bash
$ python3 spade-pytorch.py --gt_dir gt_masks
```

The threshold is calculated using the test images and the ground truth images, but you can also give a threshold.
```bash
$ python3 spade-pytorch.py --threshold 0.099380
```

By adding the `--aug` option, you can process with augmentation.  
(default is processing without augmentation)
```bash
$ python3 spade-pytorch.py --aug
```

By adding the `--aug_num` option, you can specify amplification factor of data by augmentation.
(default is 5)
```bash
$ python3 spade-pytorch.py --aug --aug_num 5
```
