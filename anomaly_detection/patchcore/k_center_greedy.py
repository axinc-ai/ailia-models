"""Returns points that minimizes the maximum distance of any point to a center.

Implements the k-Center-Greedy method in
Ozan Sener and Silvio Savarese.  A Geometric Approach to Active Learning for
Convolutional Neural Networks. https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00489 2017

Distance metric defaults to l2 distance.  Features used to calculate distance
are either raw features or if a model has transform method then uses the output
of model.transform(X).

Can be extended to a robust k centers algorithm that ignores a certain number of
outlier datapoints.  Resulting centers are solution to multiple integer program.
