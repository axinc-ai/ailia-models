    Parameters
    ----------
    segmentation : Model, str, or dict, optional
        Pretrained segmentation model. Defaults to "pyannote/segmentation@2022.07".
        See pyannote.audio.pipelines.utils.get_model for supported format.
    segmentation_step: float, optional
        The segmentation model is applied on a window sliding over the whole audio file.
        `segmentation_step` controls the step of this window, provided as a ratio of its
        duration. Defaults to 0.1 (i.e. 90% overlap between two consecuive windows).
    embedding : Model, str, or dict, optional
        Pretrained embedding model. Defaults to "pyannote/embedding@2022.07".
        See pyannote.audio.pipelines.utils.get_model for supported format.
    embedding_exclude_overlap : bool, optional
        Exclude overlapping speech regions when extracting embeddings.
        Defaults (False) to use the whole speech.
    clustering : str, optional
        Clustering algorithm. See pyannote.audio.pipelines.clustering.Clustering
        for available options. Defaults to "AgglomerativeClustering".
    segmentation_batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size used for speaker segmentation. Defaults to 1.
    embedding_batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size used for speaker embedding. Defaults to 1.
    der_variant : dict, optional
        Optimize for a variant of diarization error rate.
        Defaults to {"collar": 0.0, "skip_overlap": False}. This is used in `get_metric`
        when instantiating the metric: GreedyDiarizationErrorRate(**der_variant).
    use_auth_token : str, optional
        When loading private huggingface.co models, set `use_auth_token`
        to True or to a string containing your hugginface.co authentication
        token that can be obtained by running `huggingface-cli login`

    Usage

    # perform diarization and get one representative embedding per speaker
