## Can I apply pretrained pipelines on audio already loaded in memory?

Yes: read [this tutorial](tutorials/applying_a_pipeline.ipynb) until the end.

## Can I use gated models (and pipelines) offline?

**Short answer**: yes, see [this tutorial](tutorials/applying_a_model.ipynb) for models and [that one](tutorials/applying_a_pipeline.ipynb) for pipelines.

**Long answer**: gating models and pipelines allows [me](https://herve.niderb.fr) to know a bit more about `pyannote.audio` user base and eventually help me write grant proposals to make `pyannote.audio` even better. So, please fill gating forms as precisely as possible.

For instance, before gating `pyannote/speaker-diarization`, I had no idea that so many people were relying on it in production. Hint: sponsors are more than welcome! Maintaining open source libraries is time consuming.

That being said, this whole authentication process does not prevent you from using official `pyannote.audio` models offline (i.e. without going through the authentication process in every `docker run ...` or whatever you are using in production): see [this tutorial](tutorials/applying_a_model.ipynb) for models and [that one](tutorials/applying_a_pipeline.ipynb) for pipelines.

## Does pyannote support streaming speaker diarization?

**Short answer:** not out of the box, no.

**Long answer:** [I](https://herve.niderb.fr) am looking for sponsors to add this feature. In the meantime, [`diart`](https://github.com/juanmc2005/StreamingSpeakerDiarization) is the closest you can get from a streaming `pyannote.audio`. You might also be interested in [this blog post](https://herve.niderb.fr/fastpages/2021/08/05/Streaming-voice-activity-detection-with-pyannote.html) about streaming voice activity detection based on `pyannote.audio`.

<a name="how-can-i-improve-performance"></a>
## How can I improve performance?

**Long answer:**

1. Manually annotate dozens of conversations as precisely as possible.
2. Separate them into train (80%), development (10%) and test (10%) subsets.
3. Setup the data for use with [`pyannote.database`](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-database#speaker-diarization).
4. Follow [this recipe](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/blob/develop/tutorials/adapting_pretrained_pipeline.ipynb).
5. Enjoy.

**Also:** [I am available](https://herve.niderb.fr) for contracting to help you with that.

<a name="how-does-one-spell-and-pronounce-pyannoteaudio"></a>
## How does one spell and pronounce pyannote.audio?

üìù Written in lower case: `pyannote.audio` (or `pyannote` if you are lazy). Not `PyAnnote` nor `PyAnnotate` (sic).
üì¢ Pronounced like the french verb `pianoter`. `pi` like in `pi`ano, not `py` like in `py`thon.
üéπ `pianoter` means to play the piano (hence the logo ü§Ø).
