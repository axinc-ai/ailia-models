Timeline

.. plot:: pyplots/timeline.py

:class:`pyannote.core.Timeline` instances are ordered sets of non-empty
segments:

  - ordered, because segments are sorted by start time (and end time in case of tie)
  - set, because one cannot add twice the same segment
  - non-empty, because one cannot add empty segments (*i.e.* start >= end)

There are two ways to define the timeline depicted above:

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [25]: from pyannote.core import Timeline, Segment

  In [26]: timeline = Timeline()
     ....: timeline.add(Segment(1, 5))
     ....: timeline.add(Segment(6, 8))
     ....: timeline.add(Segment(12, 18))
     ....: timeline.add(Segment(7, 20))
     ....:

  In [27]: segments = [Segment(1, 5), Segment(6, 8), Segment(12, 18), Segment(7, 20)]
     ....: timeline = Timeline(segments=segments, uri='my_audio_file')  # faster
     ....:

  In [9]: for segment in timeline:
     ...:     print(segment)
     ...:
  [ 00:00:01.000 -->  00:00:05.000]
  [ 00:00:06.000 -->  00:00:08.000]
  [ 00:00:07.000 -->  00:00:20.000]
  [ 00:00:12.000 -->  00:00:18.000]


.. note::

  The optional *uri*  keyword argument can be used to remember which document it describes.

Several convenient methods are available. Here are a few examples:

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [3]: timeline.extent()    # extent
  Out[3]: <Segment(1, 20)>

  In [5]: timeline.support()  # support
  Out[5]: <Timeline(uri=my_audio_file, segments=[<Segment(1, 5)>, <Segment(6, 20)>])>

  In [6]: timeline.duration()  # support duration
  Out[6]: 18
