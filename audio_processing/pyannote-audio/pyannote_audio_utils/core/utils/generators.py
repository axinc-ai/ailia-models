    Parameters
    ----------
    skip : list or set
        List of labels that must be skipped.
        This option is useful in case you want to make sure generated labels
        are different from a pre-existing set of labels.

    Usage
    -----
    t = string_generator()
    next(t) -> 'A'    # start with 1-letter labels
    ...               # from A to Z
    next(t) -> 'Z'
    next(t) -> 'AA'   # then 2-letters labels
    next(t) -> 'AB'   # from AA to ZZ
    ...
    next(t) -> 'ZY'
    next(t) -> 'ZZ'
    next(t) -> 'AAA'  # then 3-letters labels
    ...               # (you get the idea)
