OXFORD VGGFace2 Dataset

We introduce a new large-scale face dataset named VGGFace2. 
The dataset contains 3.31 million images of 9131 subjects (identities), 
with an average of 362.6 images for each subject. 
Images are downloaded from Google Image Search and have large variations in 
pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession (e.g. actors, athletes, politicians). 

The whole dataset is split to a training set (including 8631 identites) 
and a test set (including 500 identites). 
The identities in the training set are disjoint with the ones in 
benchmark datasets IJB-A and IJB-B. 

The dataset is covered under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.
