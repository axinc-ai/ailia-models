# ailia MODELS : FaceIdentification

## Models for face identification

Identify person from face.

### Cityscapes

|Name|Accuracy (calculated)|Accuracy (paper)|Training Dataset|Publish Date|

## Metrics

### Accuracy (calculated)

We calculated accuracy with LFW-dataset (only 100 person) using this script.
